# LinearRegression_Diabetes
In this project, I explore a commonly used dataset from the paper ‘Least Angle Regression’ (Efron et al., 2004) that describes a collection of body and blood measurements, as well as a measurement of diabetes progression over one year. 

I first explore the data to identify potential patterns within the dataset. I then implement regression analysis to predict glucose levels based on several factors. Finally, I share my results and suggest next steps for further analysis.
